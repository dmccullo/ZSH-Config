# ZSH-Config
this is a zsh theme with my favorite features!  battery life monitoring, full path dispaly and a clean crisp font that is easy to read and easy on the eyes.
I run in iTerm2 with Dracul theme.
How to install:
Install oh-my-zsh
move .zshrc to home directory
donmcc.zsh-theme into ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes folder
move bin directory to ~/
then do a ~/.zshrc
voila my theme!
